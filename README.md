Feel free to contribute if you have any suggestions or ideas.

### Usage

##### Preperation

1. Make sure cache is writeable:  
  `chmod 777 cache/`
1. Rename settingsRename.php to settings.php:  
  `cp settingsRename.php settings.php`
1. Make sure settings file is writeable:  
  `chmod 777 settings.php`
1. Open and adjust the settings and make sure you're entered `$settings['password']`.

##### Installation

1. Open http://yourdomain.com/where-you-installed/index.php?action=admin
1. You will then be asked for a password, type in the one you set earlier.
1. You will now see the admin area.
1. Click on the "Add Server" button.
1. A dialogue box will appear with a form.
1. Fill out all the form details.
1. The dialogue box will disappear upon success, once that happens, refresh the page.
1. You should now see the server you just added in the table.
1. If you have any other servers, add them.
1. Once you have finished adding servers, please CHMOD settings.php back to 644 (If in future you need to add more, you must make it writeable again by CHMOD to 777).
1. Please be aware, the mysql settings you entered are stored in settings.php in plain text, nobody else can read it unless they are able to download the file via FTP (or SSH etc) or you have an exploit in another script on your server.
1. All done! If you have some bans, test it. Click "Home", in the search box type % and hit search. It will list all players that are currently banned or have been banned.
